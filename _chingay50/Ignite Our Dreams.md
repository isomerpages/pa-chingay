**CHINGAY50 - IGNITE OUR DREAMS**

Singapore’s annual Chingay Parade began as a humble street procession in 1973 to keep the festive atmosphere of the Chinese New Year, in compensation for the ban on firecrackers. Today, Chingay has become a uniquely Singaporean tradition and a borderless festival, which reflects our vibrant and multicultural society. The past five decades have seen Chingay evolved with creative and innovative concepts, powered by the passions, dreams and aspirations of the people.       

And now in 2022, Chingay turns 50!  With the theme “Ignite Our Dreams” — “典“ 亮妆艺五十年 «点亮•庆典•经典»; to rekindle the passion for our dreams and together, create the extraordinary out of the ordinary. Come and join us for an experience like never before as we celebrate our Golden Jubilee (庆典) with renewed appreciation of the classic performances (经典), and together light up (点亮) Chingay50 and beyond.
