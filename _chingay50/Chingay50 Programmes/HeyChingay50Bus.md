This newly commissioned design is specially created by local artist Sam Lo for Chingay50.

The inspiration comes from the colourful display of elaborate floats, costumes and performances of past Chingay Parades that showcased the rich multi-cultural elements and creativity, as well as people from different cultures coming together in harmony to celebrate. This harmonious celebration is built upon mutual respect and support.

The design uses a transitional collage with a modern twist to combine different elements across eras, ethnicities and cultures.

This bus is a special tribute to all the youths who have participated in Chingay.
