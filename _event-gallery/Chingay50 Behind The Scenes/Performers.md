# **Performers**
During the days and hours leading up to Chingay 50 on 12 February, performers and volunteers worked hard to put on an amazing show. They would arrive to Terminal 4 to do their PET Testing, don their make up and costumes and head towards Jewel Vortex to take stage. Here we have performers from Act 1.2, ScRach MarcS' Classic Mix and Shimmyrina.
