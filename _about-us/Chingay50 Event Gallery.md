**Mini Floats**

The Chingay50 Mini Floats designs were conceptualised by local community artists, art groups and Interest Groups. As part of PAssionArts efforts to promote participatory art and co-creation, the artists worked closely with the community to infuse local characteristics for each of the Mini Floats, i.e the local and iconic landmarks, which added flavour and uniqueness to these creations.
