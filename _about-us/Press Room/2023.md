From 5 to 9 February 2023, the Chingay 2023 Taster Experience would feature unique exhibits, behind-the-scenes tours, light shows and performances by foreign groups, allowing the public to get close to and interact with some of the exhibits and installations. At a preview of the parade on Thursday, 12 January 2023, Ms Tan Swee Leng, Chingay 2023 exco vice-chairman, said this year’s parade allowed for closer interactions between performers and the audience. People who could not catch the parade in person on 3 and 4 February 2023 could tune in to the live webcast, where a QR code would be flashed during the show. They could scan the code to get an invitation to sign up for exclusive workshops and experiences at the Chingay 2023 Taster Experience. Mr Kia Siang Wei, Chingay 2023 exco chairman hoped the public would get immersed in the whole experience and that 2023’s parade would be a memorable experience after two years of scaled-down celebrations. The media also reported other Chingay 2023 highlights.

In a statement on Sunday, 18 December 2022, PA stated that the parade would return physically after two years of digital and hybrid parades. According to PA, the youths involved would spray paint to create the vision of Embrace Tomorrow and give a contemporary touch to the parade. A 18 metres tall and 60 metres wide art installation made from 28 containers would become the highlight of Chingay Parade 2023. The installation was designed by Sam Lo and created together with 480 youths and would become the backdrop of Chingay Parade 2023. The design of the installation fused elements from different cultures to bring out the theme of celebrating life.

The parade would take place on 3 and 4 February 2023, and welcome audiences back to a ‘live’ showcase at the F1 Pit Building after two years of digital and hybrid parades. Mr Lim Hock Yu, Chief Executive Director said Chingay had always been about the people, about bringing people together to celebrate the unique and multi-faceted cultural mix. He added that Chingay 2023 would start a fresh chapter that involved wider community participation, including the younger generation. The theme of the Chingay Parade was "Embrace Tomorrow", calling on all Singaporeans to treasure the present and look to the future of the nation with hope. Heartland residents would also enjoy snippets of the main parade, as floats and featured performances would be taken to different residential estates.
