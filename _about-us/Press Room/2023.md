She was heartened to see the Chingay Parade continuing to be inclusive, with opportunities for people of different abilities to co-create the Chingay experience together.

The parade would take place on 3 and 4 February 2023, and welcome audiences back to a ‘live’ showcase at the F1 Pit Building after two years of digital and hybrid parades. Mr Lim Hock Yu, Chief Executive Director said Chingay had always been about the people, about bringing people together to celebrate the unique and multi-faceted cultural mix. He added that Chingay 2023 would start a fresh chapter that involved wider community participation, including the younger generation. The theme of the Chingay Parade was "Embrace Tomorrow", calling on all Singaporeans to treasure the present and look to the future of the nation with hope. Heartland residents would also enjoy snippets of the main parade, as floats and featured performances would be taken to different residential estates.
