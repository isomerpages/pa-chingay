</p>
<p>For over 50 years, Chingay has beautifully captured the spirit of multiple
generations of Singaporeans - their love for performance, unity and our
nation. Through this mural, I wish to bring this vibrancy of Chingay for
the world to see and appreciate, as well as to encapsulate the experiences
of everyone in this decades-long journey, whether as a performer, organiser
or audience.</p>

<p><strong><em>A Taste of Chingay</em> by Daphne Chua</strong>
</p>
<p>This mural is an imagination of a possible Chingay scene, where each performer
is dressed up as a local dish, forming a line-up that showcases Singapore's
diverse food culture. Behind the performers, iconic landmarks are transformed
into floats, creating a scenic backdrop that evokes a sense of belonging.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tapestry of Joy</em> by June Koh</strong>
</p>
<p>This mural presents Chingay through seal script calligraphy and a vibrant
parade of Chinese, Malay and Indian performers, as well as lion and dragon
dances. Inspired by hidden-object puzzles, it includes local icons like
laksa and Vanda Miss Joaquim, reflecting cultural heritage and unity in
diversity.</p>

<p><strong><em>Heritage In Motion</em></strong>  <strong>by Carrie Tan, Natalie Tok and Phoebe Leong</strong>
</p>
<p>This mural celebrates our identity through traditions, storytelling, community
spirit, and Chingay’s evolution. A tiger—illustrated in batik and shadow
puppetry—playfully interacts with a lion decorated with Chinese and Indian-inspired
motifs. Together, they embody harmony, diversity, and resilience, symbolising
unity among different ethnic groups. Sparks surrounding them capture the
energy and liveliness of Chingay. The mural is framed by a Peranakan tile
border featuring iconic dishes from different cultures in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong><em>Our Little Red Dot Of Joy</em> by Trixia Pearl Del Rio De Vera</strong>
</p>
<p>My mural embodies Singapore’s growth and the diversity of the Chingay
Parade on its journey towards UNESCO recognition. From left to right it
begins with a trail of dragons that recalls Chingay’s early beginnings;
red symbolises our nation and the unity of cultures. Chingay's energy and
spirit are expressed in bold colours. With vibrant patterns and Singapore’s
iconic landmarks at the centre, JOY is the focal point by celebrating through
diversity with a message is that everyone can pursue their dreams as One
Nation, One Voice, and a Million Dreams through timeless joy.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><em>The Chingay Spirit</em> by Heng Wee An (Xing Wei'an)</strong>
</p>
<p>My artwork showcases Chingay’s journey, starting from a simple celebration
among the Chinese in neighbourhoods, to a huge yearly celebration among
all races with strong and vibrant community spirit, as well as the five
decades of hard work leading to UNESCO.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><em>Kaleidoscopic</em> by Amanda Chong</strong>
</p>
<p>Chingay is a festival where we celebrate Singapore’s multicultural unity
and diversity with flamboyant costumes and floats. This mural is inspired
by the colours and dynamic movements of performers where 服装和化妆融为艺术 (costumes
and make-up come together as art). The word “Chingay”, highlights the beauty
of elements coming together as one.</p>

<p><strong><em>Change in Motion</em> by Alex Tan</strong>
</p>
<p>This vibrant mural uses a dragon’s scaled body to depict 50 years of Chingay.
From sepia tones to vivid hues, it reflects Singapore’s multicultural spirit,
symbolising unity, growth, and the festival’s continuous evolution in motion.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><em>Where Imagination Roars</em> by Mohammed Shahrizam Mohamed Shariff</strong>
</p>
<p>This mural captures the dreamlike spirit of Chingay and its aspiration
toward recognition by UNESCO. It begins with two children opening a book,
symbolising imagination and the endless possibilities of storytelling.
A magical wave of colour and fantasy flows from its pages, unfolding into
a vibrant celebration of Singapore’s multicultural essence. Dance, costumes,
and motifs from ethnic traditions intertwine, showcasing harmony, diversity,
and our nation’s unified heartbeat. The culminating float—a majestic lion—roars
proudly, symbolising Chingay's enduring strength and vitality. This is
a tributing to our rich cultural mosaic and to Chingay’s vision of being
recognised globally as a living heritage that inspires unity and imagination.</p>

<p><strong><em>Carnival of Cultures</em> by Shweta Gusain</strong>
</p>
<p>My artwork for the Chingay Parade celebrates Singapore’s vibrant heritage
and the unity of its people. I drew inspiration from traditional cultural
motifs and colours that represent the rich tapestry of our nation’s history.
It reflects the harmony, resilience, and diversity of our community spirit.</p>
