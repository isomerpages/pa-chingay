<p>This year's parade, themed "JOY, " is a vibrant celebration of our shared
experiences and cultural heritage, featuring a diverse display of community
participation.</p>
<p>As Singapore celebrates its 60th National Day, Chingay Parade 2025 will
bring communities and families together into a vibrant "Food Wonderland".
JOY is about food, families eating together (Family Joy), sharing stories
and cultures (Community Joy) and celebrations and achievements (National
Joy). Whether it is a humble home-cooked meal, a hearty hawker dish, or
a beautifully plated fine-dining entr√©e, food fosters bonds, encourages
participation and creates lasting memories.</p>
