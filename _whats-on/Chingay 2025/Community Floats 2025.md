<span style="font-weight: bold;">About Chingay Community Floats</span></div>

<div style="padding-top:1rem; padding-bottom:1rem; font-size:1.1rem">        

The community floats debuted at Chingay Parade 2022, where residents with guidance from local artists, get to showcase their co-creations and creativity on a national platform. &nbsp;The co-creation workshops held several weeks to months enabled residents the opportunity to interact with one another, contribute their creativity and have been a great way for neighbours and friends to foster a sense of identity, ownership and being part of the community. &nbsp;This initiative exemplifies the community’s active participation in the Chingay Parade, an annual celebration of multiculturalism and diversity. <br><br>
	
Chingay 2025 will feature a record-breaking 23 floats, including 14 community floats, and for the first time, a District-level float spanning 12 metres.&nbsp; <br>

A biryani bright, a veggie delight. <br>  
A colourful dish, a wondrous sight. <br>
With carrots and peas, and spices so sweet. <br>  
A fragrant aroma, a tasty treat.  
With rice as feathers, so fragrant and nice. <br> 
A veggie peacock, a stunning sight.

<div style="padding:1rem; font-size:1.1rem"><span style="font-weight: bold;line-height:2rem;">About the Co-Creation</span><br> The "Tidbit Galaxy" Southwest District Float came to life through community workshops. Residents hand-painted large hawflake canvases and decorated custom wrappers under the guidance of the lead artist and skilled facilitators. They designed and painted the plywood cut-outs of tidbit packaging into colourful, personalised stars for the galaxy-themed play area. A giant fish was created using scales cut from recycled PVC banners, spray-painted and assembled by the residents. These hands-on activities, suitable for all skill levels, allowed residents to leave their mark on the float, turning everyday materials into an extraordinary celebration of Singapore's beloved tidbits.</div>
