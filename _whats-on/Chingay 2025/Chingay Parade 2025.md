Chingay 2025 returns with the theme "Joy", inviting members of the public to reflect on shared experiences transcending ethnicity, language and age through food. <br>

The culinary extravaganza will unfold across an overture and five acts, featuring more than 4,000 performers, food-inspired floats, vibrant costumes, and dynamic music and choreography that encapsulate Singapore’s rich cultural tapestry, artistic talent, and collective spirit. It will captivate audiences with a four-level stage for performers.

 <div><img src="/images/Chingay2025/ComFloat.jpg" style="padding: 1rem;"></div>

<p>The community floats debuted at Chingay Parade 2022, where residents with guidance from local artists, get to showcase their co-creations and creativity on a national platform.  The co-creation workshops held several weeks to months enabled residents the opportunity to interact with one another, contribute their creativity and have been a great way for neighbours and friends to foster a sense of identity, ownership and being part of the community.  This initiative exemplifies the community’s active participation in the Chingay Parade, an annual celebration of multiculturalism and diversity.</p>
