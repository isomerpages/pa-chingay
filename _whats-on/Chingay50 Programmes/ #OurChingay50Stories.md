Chingay turns 50 in 2022 and it's story and journey will be unfolded through the lenses of the people involved. Our performers, volunteers, audiences, crew members and even community partners have come together to share their memories and experiences through 50 stories anchoring on the Chingay50 theme "Ignite our Dreams".

Take the journey and reminisce with us!
