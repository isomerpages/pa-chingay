This newly commissioned design is specially created by local artist Sam Lo for Chingay50.

The inspiration comes from the colourful display of elaborate floats, costumes and performances of past Chingay Parades that showcased the rich multi-cultural elements and creativity, as well as people from different cultures coming together in harmony to celebrate. This harmonious celebration is built upon mutual respect and support.

The design uses a transitional collage with a modern twist to combine different elements across eras, ethnicities and cultures.

This design is inspired by the “YouthResilient” float presented by the People's Association Youth Movement (PAYM) at Chingay 2017.

Chingay is a People’s Parade and through the years, youths have always formed a core part of Chingay, be it as performers or volunteers. Many students from various educational institutions have participated in Chingay over the years and the parade would not have been a success without many of these youth volunteers working tirelessly behind the scenes.

This bus is a special tribute to all the youths who have participated in Chingay.
