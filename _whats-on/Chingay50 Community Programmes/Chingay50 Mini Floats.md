The Carousel evokes joyous childhood memories. **Time Carousel** features horses, sun, moon and hourglass of different shapes and colours co-created by about 150 residents from Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC over 10 workshops. It symbolises the unity of Singaporeans as we overcome challenges while moving forward together.
