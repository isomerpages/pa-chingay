Behold a world where beauty, innovation, and fortitude intertwine, unfurling in the enchanting Titanium Garden, a wondrous spectacle set to bloom at Chingay in 2024. The theme for this year's Chingay Parade, "Blossom," has inspired a unique and captivating experience that celebrates individuality, sustainability, and the arts. At the heart of the Titanium Garden lies a revolutionary concept - the metamorphosis of recycled cutlery, such as plastic forks and spoons, into breathtaking blooms. It beckons the community to appreciate not only the enduring resilience within each person but also the alchemy of collective creativity. As the petals unfurl, the garden becomes a living tapestry, resonating with the unyielding beat, inventive spirit, and delicate charm that define the essence of the Chingay Parade.<br>

Each individual Magnolia hybrid flower is created by student participant using recyclable materials. The centre of the flower is made using a plastic container and contains an item that is of unique identity to each student participant (e.g. their favourite food, hobby, sports, etc.).  Students used their individual creativity to personalize the petals in their own preferred colours and patterns so that every flower created is unique and personalized. Thus, the different coloured petals and customized item of each flower represents a student, showcasing their own identity and character. These individual flowers are then curated onto the arch to create a floral art installation that is aligned to Chingay’s 2024 theme, Blossom.<br>

Crafted with recycled bottle caps, corrugated boards, and plastic bottles collected from a school collection drive, this magnificent installation embodies the essence of sustainability in our society. The rainbow scales, a vibrant mosaic of repurposed caps, symbolize unity within diversity which is a reflection of our society. “enCAPsule Dragon” also showcases the transformative power of collaborative art while inspiring a shared responsibility for our planet. The dragon, a symbol of strength, wisdom, and good fortune, takes on a new role as a guardian of reduce, reuse and recycle, encouraging us to reflect on our impact and make mindful choices for the well-being of our planet. Through this whimsical creation, St Gabriel’s Primary School welcomes a brand new year ahead, where recycled materials breathe life into a dragon's tale.<br>

The flower sculpture is made of materials that can be recycled such as straws and EVA foam with a wire structure to keep its shape. The colourful straws and foam were intended to bring about a new perspective and uniqueness of texture to the artwork. With synchronised effort to create a unique and colourful bouquet of blooms, we were rigorous in our efforts, at times repetitive and at times difficult, but ultimately able to harmonise the structure and details envisioned in our contemporary ideation. As we progressed, we were exposed to other ways on how to create an artwork apart from the usual sketching and painting. Furthermore, we understood floral art installations on a bigger scale and a deeper level. Our students thoroughly enjoyed the sessions and hope the artwork of Blooms will add to the joyful and beautiful atmosphere of Chingay at the F1 Pit Building.<br>

In the heart of a sunlit meadow, "Blossom Dreamscape" unfurls its vibrant tapestry. A collaborative work by students and teachers from Yuvabharathi International School (YBIS), guided by artists (Jackson Teo, Didier Ng, Cherie Ng, and Thian Zhiwen), the dreamcatchers, woven from a symphony of colourful fabric remnants on upcycled hangers, sway gently in the breeze, capturing fragments of imagination and whispers of forgotten dreams. With used saree fabrics, old t-shirts, used compact discs (CDs), leftover yarns, and upcycled hangers, both students and teachers were able to create an abundance of dreamcatchers, filled with colours and designs, showcasing each individuals’ personalities.<br>

In a serene garden, the "Boxed Botanicals" stands as a testament to transformation. Recovered Tetra Packs with metallic sheen, from the school-wide Tetra Pack collection efforts, take on new lives as sun catchers. With the creativity of the students and teachers, some of the school’s identities were embedded onto the newly formed flowers using car decal stickers. Through creating this art installation experience, students not only acquire valuable knowledge but also gain profound insights into the significant role that art plays in promoting environmental sustainability.<br>

This Chingay art project is not just a creative endeavour but a powerful statement on the significance of teamwork and environmental responsibility. The whole school supported us on this artwork and unite together to turn recycled plastic bottles into beautiful plastic flowers and butterflies, reinforcing the idea that collective efforts can contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future. Each plastic flower symbolises the unique individual who work tirelessly to create this masterpiece. Our project also serves as a reminder that small actions can make a big impact on the well-being of our planet.<br>
