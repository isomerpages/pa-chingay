Chingay returns to the F1 Pit Building in the first year since its Golden Jubilee, and the first physical parade after two years of hybrid and digital showcases. 

Themed “Embrace Tomorrow”, the festive parade completes the trilogy that began with “Light of Hope” in 2021 and “Ignite our Dreams” in 2022; calling on Singaporeans to treasure the present and embrace tomorrow as a community with hope, dream and confidence. 

Audiences can look forward to the comeback of iconic Chingay floats and 17 community co-created mini floats, indulge in the colourful and vibrant parade by the diverse talents and multi-ethnic community performed in front of a street-style container art backdrop that is co-created by youths.
