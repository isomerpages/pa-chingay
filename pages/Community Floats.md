The community floats debuted at Chingay Parade 2022, where residents with guidance from local artists, get to showcase their co-creations and creativity on a national platform. &nbsp;The co-creation workshops held several weeks to months enabled residents the opportunity to interact with one another, contribute their creativity and have been a great way for neighbours and friends to foster a sense of identity, ownership and being part of the community. &nbsp;This initiative exemplifies the communityâ€™s active participation in the Chingay Parade, an annual celebration of multiculturalism and diversity.
