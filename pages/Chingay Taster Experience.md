<br>Trainer: Fish Jaafar is known for producing large scale works as well as conceptual accessibility and relevance to the local community. He believe narratives are at its most honest when expressed figuratively within a traditional 2D plane. In his work, he attempts to reflect his sense of the times we are living in, and both how richly interesting they are and how difficult it is for most of us to navigate our uncertainty. Aside from murals, his studio works on 3D fabrications namely large theming works for Resorts World Sentosa Singapore, large scale installations, facade art and among others. Recently he delves into the opposite end with way smaller works such as painting tiny 3D printed miniature figurines.
