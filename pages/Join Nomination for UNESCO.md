**Why is Chingay important to Singapore?** <br>
Chingay embodies the multiculturalism of Singaporean communities, reflecting their diversity, traditions as well as visual and performing arts. &nbsp;It is a platform that unites people from all walks of life, fostering a sense of belonging and national pride. &nbsp;The parade’s themes often highlight Singapore’s achievements, aspirations, and cultural identity. &nbsp;Held on 4th February 1973, the first Chingay saw the People’s Association teaming up with the Singapore National Pugilistic Federation to put up a grand parade. &nbsp;The main elements in the inaugural parade included various aspects of Chinese culture such as dragon and lion dances, martial arts and street opera performed in local dialects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Since then, it has evolved and has grown to become a significant community-centred event in the nation’s socio-cultural calendar. &nbsp;Today, it is commemorated through an engaging parade that is renowned for its dazzling and characteristic floats, intricate props and cultural performances from diverse cultural and ethnic communities.&nbsp; These require specific skills and knowledge which are passed down from the senior to younger practitioners, and between cultural communities.&nbsp; In addition, the annual parade involves multiple communities of all ages and backgrounds, such as local practitioners and artists from a wide range of performing art forms, community groups and interest groups; community volunteers; as well as international participants which facilitate cross-cultural exchanges.
