<h2>Spot The Difference: Chingay 1973</h2>
<p>Our very first Chingay procession on 4 Feb 1973 started at the former
Victoria School at King George’s Avenue (the current headquarters of People’s
Association) and spanned 8km to Outram Park! The picture captured the start
of the iconic Chingay Parade and memories of many.</p>
