**Joint Nomination for the Inscription of Chingay onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity**

**Chingay for UNESCO**

Chingay: a street parade that showcases multiculturalism, traditions, and artistic displays of communities in both Malaysia and Singapore. Both countries will jointly nominate Chingay onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in March 2025 as an SG60 milestone and a joint effort with Malaysia to mark 60 years of bilateral ties. This would mark Singapore’s third nomination to the List.

In Singapore, Chingay is a vibrant and colourful street parade that has captivated Singaporeans for generations. It’s a testament to the nation’s rich cultural heritage and a symbol of unity, diversity, and creativity. Chingay now owns the reputation as one of Asia’s largest street performance and float parade, a colourful epitome of the country’s multi-cultural society. 

Chingay is also practised in Malaysia, in the cities of Johor Bahru and Penang as important multicultural events. Held annually at the Johor Bahru Old Chinese Temple on the 21st day of the first month of the Lunar New Year since the 1870, it is organised by Johor Bahru Tionghua Association and features creative floats and traditional performances from both Chinese and non-Chinese groups. In Penang, it is organised as a multicultural and secular performance by Penang Chingay Association in the Georgetown historical area, involving both local and overseas performers and communities.

**Why is Chingay important to Singapore?**
The UNESCO nomination for Chingay is a significant step in promoting this living heritage in Malaysia and Singapore.

A successful nomination would bring numerous benefits: Chingay showcases the shared cultural heritage of both countries while highlighting the distinctiveness of Chingay in each country. Its inclusion on the UNESCO Representative List will raise global awareness of this living heritage.

It promotes the transmission of Chingay as a living heritage. The UNESCO’s inscription could energise and raise interest among younger practitioners, ensuring that Chingay remains a vital part of Singapore’s and Malaysia’s cultural landscape for generations to come. 

The nomination of Chingay would not only promote cultural diversity and understanding but also cultivate a deeper sense of ownership and pride among communities. It can inspire individuals and groups to actively participate in its celebration and transmission. This increased involvement will ensure that Chingay remains a living tradition, reflecting the dynamic and evolving spirit of the community.

Chingay is now a uniquely Singaporean tradition that is usually held during the second weekend of the Chinese New Year and celebrated by Singaporeans and Singapore residents from all ethnicities - Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians and many others. For Chingay audiences, the event offers a treasured glimpse into the dynamism of Singapore’s vibrant multi-culturalism and exciting global cultures.

A dazzling extravaganza of colours and cultural diversity, this signature and iconic event is proudly created by our people, regardless of age, race, language and creed, as we welcome everyone to come together to celebrate as ONE.
