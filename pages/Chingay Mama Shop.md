I treasure spending quality family time together, just like how I was brought up. I especially love meal times when we come together to share about our day and how a simple dinner can create so much fond memories together. I used to print many colouring pages for my girl to colour. But after a while, I realised that this is not sustainable, and how can I create a little something where colouring and dining can coexist together. That’s how Busy Mat came about. Fun, Learn and Dine with Busy Mat 
We want dining to be fun, interactive and educational 
Designed by myself, as I learn and grow alongside with my girl. Colour Busy Mat, have fun and use it as a placemat to dine after that, it’s that simple.
Keeping screens away and at the same time having quality dinner time is what I wish to advocate to all families.

<span style="line-height:2rem;color:#b242a2;font-weight:bold">Vesiderm Pte Ltd</span><br>Vesiderm was started with a focus on developing and commercializing innovative process technologies and applications in the skincare industry. Our story began when a team of scientists at A-STAR Singapore developed an innovative technology to manufacture liposomes rapidly on a massive scale. These liposomes were carefully analysed and verified by electron microscopy, nano particle tracking analysis and mass spectrometry to be “true” liposomes that are uniformly sized with a diameter of 150 nanometers.
Vesiderm acquired a licence to the technology in 2014, and used the technology to manufacture our proprietary Vesiderm™ Liposomes from egg yolk lecithin as actives in daily skincare products. Rigorous extensive research by A-STAR scientists, in collaboration with KKH Paediatric Dermatologists, found that the topical application of our unique Vesiderm™ liposomes reinforces skin barrier function against chemical agents such as psoriasis-inducing IMQ, thus alleviating inflammation. This discovery represents a new disruptive innovation in skin care and skin moisturising that will be of significant benefit to in alleviating age-associated chronic inflammation and aging process in the skin.
