<div style="padding:1rem; font-size:1.1rem"><span style="font-weight: bold;line-height:2rem;">About Fire Flower:  A Celebration of Community</span><br> Fireworks are usually reserved for special occasions.  In Singapore, the most prominent fireworks display occurs annually during the National Day Parade, celebrating the country's independence and accomplishments. <br>
	The Marsiling-Yew Tee community has ingeniously crafted a stunning spectacle by constructing a cityscape that mirrors the aspirations and history of their own community.  The mechanical contraption, skilfully expanding and contracting the LED flower ornaments, replicates the effect of fireworks illuminating the skyline.  The fireworks display is assembled through the painstaking efforts of collecting, washing, and reshaping the collected plastic bottles. <br>
At the heart of the community float is a large kinetic display of a firework bursting and blossoming into the sky, symbolizing the community’s creativity and unity.</div>

After shredding the plastic into tiny flakes, the recycled materials were melted and molded using an injection molding machine.  These meticulously formed petals were then affixed to 3D printed cores adorned with LEDs, bringing to life each mesmerising burst of the mechanical firework. </div>
