Each voice displays ingenuity and together they form rich tapestries of our time, using whatever that is accessible to tell our stories.
It was first presented at PAssionArts Festival 2023 that saw collaborative effort by residents, each contributing a piece of tapestry crafted from repurposed fabric scraps. The residents transformed discarded materials by weaving and patching them into unique art pieces, showcasing the beauty of creativity and sustainability. This collective endeavor not only celebrates the spirit of community collaboration but also highlights the potential for artistic expression.
Proudly led by Bukit Batok Community Arts and Culture Club, residents continued to be engaged to add on giant flowers made of upcycled material to further complement the original art installation..<br>
The cosmos flowers, handmade by the Ang Mo Kio community, represent order, peace, and harmony.  Amidst this natural ballet, mandarin ducks are regarded as symbols of love, trust and fidelity.  The artwork aims to celebrate the cyclical beauty of migration and the fleeting charm of the cosmos flowers.

<div style="padding:1rem; font-size:1.1rem"><span style="font-weight: bold;line-height:2rem;">A SUSTAINABLE SYMPHONY OF MERLION MAJESTY AND MOUSEDEER MAGIC</span><br> Greetings from a city full of life! Each voice displays ingenuity and together they form rich tapestries of our time, using whatever that is accessible to tell our stories.
It was first presented at PAssionArts Festival 2023 that saw collaborative effort by residents, each contributing a piece of tapestry crafted from repurposed fabric scraps. The residents transformed discarded materials by weaving and patching them into unique art pieces, showcasing the beauty of creativity and sustainability. This collective endeavor not only celebrates the spirit of community collaboration but also highlights the potential for artistic expression.
Proudly led by Bukit Batok Community Arts and Culture Club, residents continued to be engaged to add on giant flowers made of upcycled material to further complement the original art installation..<br>
The cosmos flowers, handmade by the Ang Mo Kio community, represent order, peace, and harmony.  Amidst this natural ballet, mandarin ducks are regarded as symbols of love, trust and fidelity.  The artwork aims to celebrate the cyclical beauty of migration and the fleeting charm of the cosmos flowers.

<div style="padding:1rem; font-size:1.1rem"><span style="font-weight: bold;line-height:2rem;">HEY THERE, DID YOU KNOW?</span><br> If you look closely, some of the art installations are constructed from upcycled materials. Pretty cool, right? By repurposing these materials, the artists and residents involved got super creative! Items that may otherwise have ended up in landfills are given a new lease of life here!<br>
	
<br> These lights on the trees are repurposed from Christmas on A Great Street 2023. We are happy that Orchard Road Business Association (ORBA) is supporting this initiative to decorate our surroundings sustainably!<br>
