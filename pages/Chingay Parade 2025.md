Chingay 2025 returns with the theme "Joy", inviting members of the public to reflect on shared experiences transcending ethnicity, language and age through food. <br>

The culinary extravaganza will unfold across an overture and five acts, featuring more than 4,000 performers, 23 food-inspired floats, vibrant costumes, and dynamic music and choreography that encapsulate Singaporeâ€™s rich cultural tapestry, artistic talent, and collective spirit. It will captivate audiences with a four-level stage for performers.
