<div style="padding:1rem; font-size:1.1rem">

PAssionArts Stret is a fun, interactive and immersive experience for everyone, young and old, to participate in various hands-on-arts activities. You can enjoy a vibrant mix of performances and explore stunning array of visual arts installations re-staged from PAssionArts Festival (PAF), Giant Delight and JOYOUS ART-VENTURE, curated by Art Director, Sam Lo. <br>
	
This exhibition takes food to an entirely new level, showcasing its cultural significance through bold and imaginative installations. From iconic local dishes like chilli crab to the much-loved durian, each piece delves into how food not only sustains us but also binds us together as a community. The vibrant, larger-than-life displays offer a playful yet meaningful exploration of food's role in shaping shared identity and daily joy.
<br>
	
18 Community Arts &amp; Culture Clubs (CACCs) and 8 schools are involved to present this one-of-a-kind outdoor arts installations co-created by community artists, students and residents.

<div style="padding:1rem; font-size:1.1rem"><span style="font-weight: bold;line-height:2rem;"> WEAVE</span><br><br> Greetings from a city full of life! Each voice displays ingenuity and
together they form rich tapestries of our time, using whatever that is
accessible to tell our stories.<br><br>
It was first presented at PAssionArts Festival 2023 that saw
collaborative effort by residents, each contributing a piece of tapestry
crafted from repurposed fabric scraps. The residents transformed
discarded materials by weaving and patching them into unique art
pieces, showcasing the beauty of creativity and sustainability. This
collective endeavor not only celebrates the spirit of community
collaboration but also highlights the potential for artistic expression.<br><br>
	Proudly led by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bukit Batok Community Arts and Culture Club</span>, residents continued to be engaged to add on giant flowers made of
upcycled material to further complement the original art installation.
