The exhibition celebrates food in all its larger-than-life glory, reimagined in spectacular gastronomical proportions.&nbsp; Through a vibrant collection of installations, we explore the profound ways of food shapes and reflects Singaporeâ€™s rich cultural tapestry.

From beloved local dishes like chilli crab to the iconic durian, the joy of food is told through stories spanning our bustling pasar malam to the innovative world of urban farming.&nbsp; Each piece highlights the multi-faceted creativity and deep connections within our communities, showcasing how food nourishes not just the body but also our shared identity.

These joyful and colourful works invite us to reflect on the ways food forms our culture, bringing delight and inspiration to our everyday lives.

These art installations were first presented at the PAssionArts Festival 2023 around Singapore Art Week x PAssionArts and are re-staged here at

<div style="padding:1rem; font-size:1.1rem"><span style="font-weight: bold;line-height:2rem;"> WEAVE</span><br><br> Greetings from a city full of life! Each voice displays ingenuity and
together they form rich tapestries of our time, using whatever that is
accessible to tell our stories.<br><br>
It was first presented at PAssionArts Festival 2023 that saw
collaborative effort by residents, each contributing a piece of tapestry
crafted from repurposed fabric scraps. The residents transformed
discarded materials by weaving and patching them into unique art
pieces, showcasing the beauty of creativity and sustainability. This
collective endeavor not only celebrates the spirit of community
collaboration but also highlights the potential for artistic expression.<br><br>
	Proudly led by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bukit Batok Community Arts and Culture Club</span>, residents continued to be engaged to add on giant flowers made of
upcycled material to further complement the original art installation.
